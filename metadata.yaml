description: Up-to-date and secure image. WordPress is the world's most popular blogging
  and content management platform. Powerful yet simple, everyone from students to
  global corporations use it to build beautiful, functional websites.
readme: "WordPress powers over 25% of all websites on the internet, making it the
  world's most popular blogging and content management platform. It is free and open
  source software developed entirely by its community, who have contributed over 45,000
  themes, plugins, and widgets that enable an unlimited combination of features. Users
  can easily create and edit static webpages and blog posts using its intuitive editor.
  Without even thinking about details like browser compatibility or responsiveness,
  content creators are free to create and format text, images, and layout on every
  page and post.\r\n\r\nMore tech savvy will appreciate having the ability to easily
  switch back and forth between a WYSIWYG editor and raw html for every page, and
  the underlying PHP that runs it all is available right through the interface.\r\n\r\nWhy
  use Bitnami Apps? \r\n\r\nBitnami certified images are always up-to-date, secure,
  and built to work right out of the box. \r\n\r\nBitnami packages applications following
  industry standards and continuously monitors all components and libraries for vulnerabilities
  and application updates. When any security threat or update is identified, Bitnami
  automatically repackages the applications and pushes the latest versions to the
  cloud marketplaces."
